/**
 * Canonical sentence-case labels the shared command registry
 * (`@inkeep/open-knowledge-core/commands`) points its `labelKey` at. Most
 * surface in BOTH the native Electron menu bar (`packages/desktop/src/main/menu.ts`)
 * and the in-app renderer (`FileTree.tsx` / `FileSidebar.tsx` and the Cmd+K
 * palette); a few (e.g. `openGraph`, `initializeStarterPack`, the Show/Hide
 * toggle variants) are palette-only, kept here so the label-parity test guards
 * them and the registry keeps a single label source.
 *
 * Why a shared constant: the same action surfaces twice and the two copies
 * must read identically. The native menu has no i18n runtime, so it imports
 * these strings directly. The renderer wraps the SAME strings in Lingui
 * `<Trans>` / t`` macros — those macros require a string literal at the call
 * site, so the renderer can't import these constants — but a parity test
 * (`packages/app/src/lib/menu-label-parity.test.ts`) asserts every value here
 * is present in the renderer's compiled catalog, keeping both surfaces in
 * lockstep.
 *
 * Casing follows the app's sentence-case convention
 * (`packages/app/scripts/audit-strings/check-casing.ts`). Proper nouns keep
 * their capitals (Finder, Terminal, AI). Native menu items that open a new
 * surface append the platform ellipsis (…) per the Apple HIG — that suffix is
 * native-only and is added at the menu render site (the command registry's
 * per-placement `ellipsis` flag), not stored here.
