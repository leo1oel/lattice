/**
 * The text a non-text inline node contributes when the input-rule runner
 * derives the string it matches rules against.
 *
 * `@tiptap/core` builds that string by concatenating one chunk per node before
 * the caret, then computes the replacement range as pure arithmetic:
 * `from - (match[0].length - text.length)`. That arithmetic is correct only
 * while every node contributes exactly as many characters as it occupies
 * document positions, and two node shapes break it:
 *
 *  - A leaf with no text falls back to the literal `"%leaf%"` — six characters
 *    for one position. A rule whose body spans one computes a range five
 *    positions too far left: far enough to land before the document start and
 *    throw `RangeError` out of `handleTextInput`, crashing the keystroke, or —
 *    when enough text precedes it to keep the range positive — to silently
 *    rewrite the wrong span.
 *  - A node with children is skewed the other way, and by an amount that varies
 *    with its content: the runner reads the wrapper AND descends into it, so
 *    the children's text is counted twice while the wrapper's own two positions
 *    are counted not at all.
 *
 * Both are one defect — a node's contributed length must equal the positions it
 * owns — so one rule fixes both: contribute a placeholder per structural
 * position and let the children speak for themselves.

 *
 * For a node with children the placeholders lead rather than bracket the
