 * a full-height picker parked over the caret line whenever the caret sits too

 *   Starts with `visibility: hidden` — caller must call `reveal()` once content
 *   is ready and stable. This prevents the "flash at wrong position" artifact
 *   when the popup is placed before its final content is rendered.
 * - doPosition: trigger repositioning (call after content changes in onStart
 *   and onUpdate)
 * - startAutoUpdate: call AFTER appending renderer content to preserve
 *   content-before-autoUpdate ordering (autoUpdate fires doPosition
 *   synchronously on setup — must run after popup has content so
 *   flip/placement middleware see the populated element's dimensions,
 *   not an empty container's)
 * - reveal: makes the popup visible after the next computePosition resolves.
 *   For sync menus (slash-command), call immediately after startAutoUpdate.
 *   For async menus (wiki-link), defer until items have loaded (in onStart)
 *   so flip() sees the populated content's dimensions, not the loading state's.
 *
 * Uses `popup.isConnected` guards in async callbacks because computePosition
 * is async (returns Promise). The `.then()` can resolve after cleanup has
 * called `popup.remove()` — at that point the reference is non-null but
 * disconnected. A null-check alone would miss this race.
 *
 * `clipToEditorPane` opts a picker into the editor's visible-region contract:
 * the caret it tracks lives in the document's scroll container, so the picker
 * belongs inside that container's visible box rather than merely inside the
 * window. It is opt-in rather than derived because this factory also serves the
 * COMPOSER pickers, whose caret sits in the Ask AI / comment composer — a
 * surface that legitimately floats outside the document pane, and would be
 * clamped into it by a blanket application.
