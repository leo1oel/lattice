/**
 * Typed `[text](url)` input rule for the WYSIWYG editor.
 *
 * When a local user closes a well-formed inline-link literal by typing the
 * final `)`, the `[text](url)` span collapses to its display `text` carrying a
 * `link` mark. The mark keeps the schema-default `linkStyle: 'inline'`, so it
 * serializes straight back to `[text](url)` (unlike the bare-literal
 * `gfm-autolink` style the typed-URL plugin uses). Scope is deliberately narrow
 * — the one universal Markdown link shorthand editors share (Outline, Plate).
 *
 * Safety and undo, both structural:
 *
 *  - Origin safety by construction. Input rules fire only from
 *    `handleTextInput` — a local, focused DOM keystroke — never from a y-sync
 *    transaction (remote peer, agent, disk load, observer echo) or a
 *    programmatic write into a pooled/background editor. So the "never convert
 *    another writer's content" invariant holds without an explicit origin
 *    guard, unlike the appendTransaction-based typed-URL plugin.
 *  - Href policy. The URL must pass `isAllowedLinkUri` (the shared scheme
 *    allowlist); a `javascript:`-style payload leaves the literal untouched.
 *    Relative targets resolve against the placeholder base and are allowed,
 *    matching the internal-link contract.
 *  - Undo isolation, mark kept in step with the trigger. The rule does NOT
 *    consume the `)`; it lets the paren land through normal typing (so the
 *    literal is complete in the doc) and collapses in a deferred separate
 *    dispatch a microtask later, split from the typing by `stopCapturing()`
 *    before and after. One Cmd+Z then reverts just the collapse, restoring the
 *    full `[text](url)` literal — the same trigger-char-kept, one-undo contract
 *    the gfm-autolink path has. Absent a y-undo binding there is no capture
 *    stack and nothing to split.
