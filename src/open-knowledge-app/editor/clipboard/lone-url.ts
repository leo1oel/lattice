/**
 * Lone-URL classification for the paste/drop dispatcher and the link
 * popover's clipboard pre-fill.
 *
 * A payload whose text/plain trims to a single whitespace-free token can be
 * "a pasted URL" in two senses, and the dispatcher's two paste contexts
 * deliberately apply two different policies:
 *
 * - At a cursor the conversion is autolink-shaped: only tokens the markdown
 *   pipeline's own parse would linkify (the GFM autolink-literal shapes)
 *   convert, so the inserted bytes are exactly what a markdown author would
 *   have typed and they re-parse to the identical link. Anything else —
 *   bare domains, filenames — inserts verbatim, unchanged from before this
 *   step existed.
 *
 * - Over a selected range the paste gesture itself carries link intent (the
 *   Notion/Docs "paste a URL onto selected text" idiom), so the policy is
 *   trust-the-gesture: any allowlisted-scheme URL verbatim, GFM-shape
 *   emails as `mailto:`, and schemeless dotted hosts (`example.com`,
 *   `www.example.com` — and filename-shaped tokens like `AGENTS.md`, a
 *   deliberately accepted edge of trusting the gesture) get `https://`
 *   prepended. This is
 *   deliberately looser than the typed-autolink policy because the result
 *   is an explicit `[text](url)` link whose bytes never need to re-parse as
 *   an autolink literal — and because an unwanted conversion is one undo
 *   away, on a gesture that rarely means anything but "link this".
 *
 * Both dispatcher classifiers return null for everything else; the
 * dispatcher falls through to its normal branch tree, so a non-matching
 * payload pastes exactly as it always did.
 *
 * The link popover's pre-fill applies a third, strictest policy: opening
 * the popover is an authoring gesture, not a gesture at the clipboard, so
 * the guess is speculative — only a token that is already unambiguously a
 * URL (explicit allowlisted scheme) qualifies, verbatim. No https://
 * prepending, no mailto: minting: a wrong pre-fill costs a clear-and-retype
 * with no gesture to blame, where the paste policies' conversions cost one
 * undo on a gesture that asked for a link.
