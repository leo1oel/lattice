# Experimental Windows host

Windows support currently covers project file operations, PDF reads, process
supervision, a ConPTY terminal and discovery of installed TeX distributions.
It requires Windows 10 version 1809 or later (Windows 11 recommended).

This is an experimental target. Releases whose Windows installer checks pass
also provide a per-user x64 NSIS installer, clearly marked experimental.
Download the `windows-x64-experimental-setup.exe` and its matching `.sha256`
from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/leo1oel/lattice/releases). Release
downloads need no GitHub account and have no Actions artifact expiry.
The installer is **unsigned**: SmartScreen may show an unknown-publisher warning.
Check the source and checksum before deciding whether to run it; do not disable
Windows security protections. See the matching `.README.txt` asset for setup.

There is no Windows auto-update: download each new version manually.
Authenticode signing and Windows updater support are separate future work.
The existing macOS/Linux release jobs are unchanged.
The embedded Agent remains disabled because its bibliography protection relies
on the macOS sandbox. One-click TeX and paper-tool installation are unavailable;
install TeX Live for Windows separately to compile documents. The optional rtex
live preview is still macOS-only.

## Installer builds and checks

See [the Windows installer implementation](windows-installer-proposal.md) for
triggers, isolated install/uninstall checks, public release assets and limits.
PR/manual builds provide a checked Actions ZIP (GitHub login required, 14-day
retention); only a successful upstream release can publish permanent assets.

To build locally after installing the prerequisites below:

```powershell
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm tauri build --bundles nsis --config src-tauri/tauri.windows.conf.json
```

The build stages a SHA-256-verified standalone Node with its redistribution
license and the frozen Open Slide runtime. It does not need a Synara checkout
and does not bundle its unavailable Agent server, Pandoc or uv. Interface fonts
are open-licensed. No private fonts, signing secrets or product-license keys
are loaded by the Windows workflow; tldraw uses its unlicensed mode without a key.

## Host checks

Install the [Tauri Windows prerequisites](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/),
the repository's pinned Rust toolchain, Node and pnpm. From the repository root:

```powershell
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force src-tauri/synara-runtime | Out-Null
Set-Content src-tauri/synara-runtime/placeholder.txt 'Compilation checks only'
cargo fmt --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml --all -- --check
cargo clippy --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml
```

The stub is sufficient for compilation and tests; it does not supply the bundled
Agent or presentation runtime. Link tests need Developer Mode or permission to
create Windows symbolic links. The Windows CI job runs these host checks without
packaging or publishing a binary. Its native tests exercise Unicode paths,
reparse-point refusal, atomic writes, file identities, process Job Objects and
ConPTY execution, resizing and window ownership.
